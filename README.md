#Sorting Algorithms and Big O notation

This project is an application of sorting algorithms,
that sorts a list / an array of integers using different sorting algorithms
and classifies its time complexity using big O notation.


##Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

This project considers some of these algorithms including:
	1. Bubble sort
	2. Insertion sort
	3. Merge sort
	4. Quick sort


##Big O notation

a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
according to the input size n.

In this project, an algorithm is descriped in three big O notations:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case


- This project is meant to be done by a group of two students:

1. Mazen Atlam
2. Mario Raafat
