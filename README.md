# Sorting Algorithms and Big O notation

This project is an application of sorting algorithms,
that sorts a list / an array of integers using different sorting algorithms
and classifies its time complexity using big O notation.


## Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

This project considers some of these algorithms including:

	1. Bubble sort
 	2. Insertion sort
  	3. Merge sort
   	4. Quick sort


## Big O notation

A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
according to the input size n.

In this project, an algorithm is descriped in three big O notations:

	a. in the best case
	b. in the average case
	c. in the worst case


This project is meant to be done by a group of two students:

	- Mazen Atlam
	- Mario Raafat
